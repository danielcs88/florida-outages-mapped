# FL Outages Mapped

## Usage

You should be able to map the outages by simply running:

```
datasette fl_outages.db
```

## Work

The grunt work was done by
[Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw/scrape-florida-outages), but I was
 able to transform the data into something that Datasette can plot on a map.

I probably didn't need to do all this work, but I like parquet as a format and
then, I finally converted the formatted data into a db file that works with
Datasette.
